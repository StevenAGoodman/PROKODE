# all are proteases
# a lot just have something to do with degrading proteins that dont fold correctly... but cant that just be modeled by the probability of a protein misfolding * some model-validated percentage about the rate of complex formation
    # SspB binds to the ec-SsrA tag and then caries it to ClpX increasing ClpXâ€™s specificity to the tag. By contrast, ClpS binding to ClpA reduces ClpA interactions with ec-SsrA tags [92], and enhances its role in the degradation of proteins with specific N-degrons [93,94] (figure 1c). Although the ec-SsrA tag is primarily recognized by ClpXP, it has a low affinity to other proteases such as ClpAP, Lon, FtsH and Prc (also named Tsp) 
        # constant * SspB/etc * prob ?
    prob_misfold = lambda temp, pH : smth
    decay_component = lambda prob_misfold, ClpX_amnt, SspB_amnt : prob_misfold * (ClpX_amnt / (ClpX_amnt + Kd_const))
> ClpXP 
> ClpAP
> Lon 
> FtsH
> HslUV (analogous to ClpAP)
> DegP
