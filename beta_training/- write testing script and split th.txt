- write testing script and split the data

 - find constants:
	- kd ribo to mrna
	- len taken by ribo / rnap
 - find functions:
	- natural mrna decay (like just how a molecule itself decays)
	- what proteins are associated with cell growth and by how much
	- proteins associated with the formation of ribo and rnap
		- probability of associating
	- probability of a misfolding occuring
		- what are the rates associated with removing for misfolded
		- actually you may just want to say that all misfolds are not valid
